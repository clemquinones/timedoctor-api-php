 * Consider this problem: we need to update product prices, but we need to store old prices of a product to correctly
 * render receipts.
 *
 * The solution to this problem is: to update a product type, don't update it, but copy it and disable the old
 * entity, so a user can't find it via search. Doing so is called replacement, and this trait provides such behavior
 * for an entity.
 *
 * It is safe to actually update an entity if nothing depends on in (e.g. it is safe to update a meal if there are no
 * orders placed for that meal), so in this case [[Replaceable::replace()]] will just update the original entity.
 *
 * Class must implement [[Disableable]] interface to implement this trait.
